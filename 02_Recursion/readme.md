# Recursion

Recursion is a process(or a funciton) that calls itself.

# How it works?

Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach a base case!. Base case - is the condition when recursion ends, this is the most important concept.

# Helper method recursion

Is an approach when you do not call main function as it has some var inits on top of the function. But after vars init, you create another(inner) helper function, that has access to created vars in outer function, and you recursevely invoke specifically inner function.
